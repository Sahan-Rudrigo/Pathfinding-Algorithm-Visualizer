# Pathfinding-Algorithm-Visualizer
Jupyter Notebook demonstrating and visualizing popular pathfinding algorithms

This project implements and compares two fundamental pathfinding algorithms—Breadth-First 
Search (BFS) and A* within a 2D grid environment. The goal is to navigate from a starting point 
(top-left corner) to a goal (bottom-right corner) while avoiding randomly placed obstacles. 
Developed in Python, the system leverages libraries such as ‘numpy’ for grid management, 
‘heapq’ for efficient priority queuing, and ‘tkinter’ for an interactive graphical user interface 
(GUI). The project includes a ‘Jupyter Notebook’ for initial development and a standalone GUI 
application for real-time visualization. Performance metrics, including execution time and nodes 
explored, are analyzed to evaluate the efficiency of each algorithm. This document details the 
methodology, presents results, and provides visual evidence through screenshots, offering 
insights into practical pathfinding applications such as robotics and game development.
